Data Analysis and Handling with Pandas

pandas is based on numpy

Organized and well managed data is a requirement for all steps in Al
(training,validation ,testing and predicting)

pandas is a multidimensional data handling tool

It is used for scrapping ... using tools like beautiful soup and scrappy
 
In time series the data is time bound i.e it changes with the change in time
in time series the order of data matters !
------------------------

the difference b/w numpy array and pandas series is we have associated 
index with the values


-------------------------

obj.values = returns a list containing the values of series
obj.index --- tells start stop and step (IF NOT GIVEN ANY SPECIFIED INDEXES) else it returns 
	      list containing indexes and dtype of list/indexes


pd.Series(values,index,name) 

values can be string or integer or any other datatype simultaneously

it is better to provide only a single type of dtype i.e (integer) to values
so that we can do analysis and put filters
#(sw[sw>100])


if the number of indexes is greater than the number of values:
	if we are manually making the Series or using Python List or numpy array :
		error
	if we are use dictionary:
		extra index will be appointed Nan  ----> only in case of dictionary.


							
Pandas ---> Library

Series is a class in Pandas Library


sales = pd.Series(---)

sales is an object of Series class of Pandas file    ---> file--library
